# ðŸš€ Cub3D: Un Motor de Juego 3D al Estilo Wolfenstein 3D

This project implements a basic 3D game engine using the MiniLibX library, inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. The goal is to render a 3D environment from a 2D map, allowing the player to explore a labyrinth with textures and colors.

## âœ¨ Features
* **Fast Raycasting Engine:** Real-time 3D perspective rendering from a 2D map.

* **Dynamic Player Movement:** Smooth movement (forward, backward, strafing) and rotation.

* **Collision Detection:** Prevents the player from moving through walls.

* **Textured Walls:** Walls are rendered with distinct textures based on their orientation.

* **Solid Color Floor & Ceiling:** Basic environmental elements for depth.

* **Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive validation for map and configuration files.
